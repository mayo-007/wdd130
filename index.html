        <p>Welcome to my portal!, I'm Mayerly Roxana Palma Apolinario and I'm a student at BYU enrolled
        in the WDD 130 course. I was born in the warm city of Guayaquil in Ecuador. I love my country,
        my culture and I really enjoy the local cuisine. I think my developed skill is my curiosity 
        since I am always willing to learn new things. </p>

        <p>Ecuador is located in the middle of the World, it has borders between Colombia and Peru.
        Also, it is famous for the Galapagos Islands, crystal-blue beaches and the snow-capped
        peaks of the Andes Mountains. Although small, Ecuador has a very diverse landscape.</p>
